      <section class="main-section" id="What_is_Magic:_The_Gathering?"><header><h2>What is Magic: The Gathering?</h2></header><p>When Magic: The Gathering, created by game designer Richard Garfield, was first unveiled at Gen Con in '93, it was an immediate success. The concept--cards of varying rarities, randomly assorted in "booster packs," that can be played with in near-limitless combinations-- was revolutionary at the time. Without Magic, the Hearthstones, Pokemons, and Yu-Gi-Ohs! of the world would look a whole lot different, and might not exist at all.</p>
      <p>In Magic, you take on the role of a "Planeswalker"--a powerful mage, capable of traversing the many "planes," or dimensions, of the Multiverse (the fictional universe where the Magic story takes place). To defeat your opponent, a fellow Planeswalker, you must cast spells and summon creatures powerful enough to outmatch theirs.</p>

      <p>Contrary to popular belief, Magic is not a tabletop RPG like Dungeons & Dragons (though both games are owned by Wizards of the Coast). There may be plenty of elves, dragons, and sorcery at play, but where D&D is all about imagination and teamwork, Magic is a cutthroat, competitive card game through and through.</p>
      <p>The gameplay and strategy of Magic are frequently described as a combination of poker and chess. Like poker, variance and hidden information are both central to the game, so some knowledge of statistics, bluffing, and concepts like "expected value" is key to success. And like chess, there are near-infinite different ways any given game can play out, so thinking a few turns ahead, and having a plan for how to take down your opponent, are both crucial skills.</p>

      <p>As for the story, it's been being continuously written for the past 30 years, so the lore is incredibly deep and complicated by this point. It follows a handful of recurring Planeswalker characters as they traverse the many worlds of the Multiverse--fighting wars, saving civilizations, making and breaking allegiances... the typical fantasy goodness. Whenever a new major set of cards is released (which happens about four times a year), the story is expanded upon, with the backdrop of whatever particular plane that set takes place in.</p>
      <p>You can piece together what's going on just by looking at the art and reading "flavor text" (short, italicized story blurbs you'll find printed on some cards). Or, if you're the type to get deep into lore, you can check out the regularly released, free-to-read <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/story" target="_blank">story content</a> published by Wizards of the Coast. Luckily, you don't need to know anything about the story to start playing, so the amount you chose to engage with that side of the game is entirely up to you.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="The_Rules"><header><h2>The Rules</h2></header><p>Learning the rules of Magic: The Gathering is the part of the process that all too often scares new players away. The official comprehensive <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2022/downloads/MagicCompRules%2020221118.pdf" target="_blank">rulebook</a> for the game is almost 300 pages long, after all! Needless to say, what follows is not an exhaustive explanation. But don't think you need to know every single corner case and minutia before playing your first game. Understanding the basics is all you need to get started; the rest comes naturally with time and practice.</p>

          <h3>The Basics</h3>
        </header>
        <p>In a typical 1v1 game of Magic, each player starts at 20 life with seven cards in hand, drawn from their respective decks (there are exceptions, which we'll get to in the "Formats" section). After rolling a die to see who goes first, players then take turns, drawing one card from their deck at the start of each of their turns. The first player to get their opponent's life total to zero wins the game.</p>

        <p>Sounds simple, right? Well, it basically is! Where it gets more complicated is in the specifics of the cards themselves, how they function, and how they interact with each other. To understand what the process of winning a game of magic actually looks like, let's take a look at the different types of cards.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section sub-section the-rules" id="Card_Types">
        <header>
          <h3>Card Types</h3>
        </header>
        <p>There are seven main different card types in Magic: The Gathering, which you'll find noted underneath the art on every card. There are two different classes of card types: "Permanents" and "non-permanents." Permanent cards stay on the battlefield after you play them, whereas non-permanents have a one-time effect, after which the card goes to your graveyard.</p>

          <p>We'll start with the permanents.</p>
          <section class="main-section sub-section sub-sub-section lands" id="Lands"></section>
          <header><h4>Lands</h4></header>
          <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463645/4091768-forest.jpeg" alt="forest card"><caption>Forest</caption>
        <p>Lands are arguably the most important card type in Magic. They're how you pay for the spells you cast, so without them, the rest of the cards in your deck are useless. For this reason, most decks will consist of between 40-45% lands; you want to have a few in your opening seven-card hand to ensure you'll be able to play out the rest of your cards.</p>
        <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463645/4091626-bear.jpeg" alt="grizzly bears card"><caption>Grizzly Bears</caption>
        <p>Your lands pay for your spells by providing a magical energy source, known as "mana." The mana cost of any card is listed in the top right corner. (Grizzly Bears, for example, costs one green mana, plus another mana of any color).</p>
        <p>The specific color of mana added by your lands depends on the type of land ("Plains" tap for white mana, "Islands" for blue, "Swamps" for black, "Mountains" for red, and "Forests" for green). To add mana, you must turn your land sideways. This action is known as "tapping." You'll see it represented by a circular right arrow symbol on cards. Your permanents stay tapped until the beginning of your next turn, so once you tap a land for mana, you can't use it again until your next turn.</p>
        <p>In a game of Magic, you can play one land card per turn. Since they're permanent cards, they'll stay on your side of the battlefield for the duration of the game once you play them. So, the later into a game you get, the more expensive cards you'll be able to cast. On turn one, you'll only have one land in play, so you can only play something that costs one mana. But if you've managed to play a land every turn by turn five, you can play something that costs five. Getting there is no guarantee, however; not drawing enough lands, and therefore being unable to play your spells, is referred to as getting "mana screwed"--a common complaint you'll hear from salty players. As we noted at the top, variance is a big part of the game.</p>
        <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463645/4091642-dimirtapland.jpeg" alt="Dimir Guildgate card"><caption>Dimir Guildgate</caption>
        <p>The basic lands--Plains, Islands, Swamps, Mountains, and Forests--all only tap for the one color that they produce. Non-basic lands, however, can often tap for two or more different colors of mana. Lands like this typically come with some sort of drawback. Dimir Guildgate, for example, enters the battlefield tapped, so you can't use it until the following turn.</p>

          <h3>The Golden Rule</h3>
          <p>We've laid out the basics of how a game of Magic works, and how the different types of cards function and interact. However, as you go forth and continue learning and getting a lay of the land, it's important to remember one of the "Golden Rules" of Magic: The Gathering. As stated in the official rulebook:</p>

<p class="italic"></p>"Whenever a card's text directly contradicts [the] rules, the card takes precedence..."</p>

<p>This fundamental is at the heart of what makes Magic such a vast game, with near-infinite new situations to discover and problems to solve. The rules themselves are fairly simple; it's the cards that break these rules that open up endless possibilities.</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>

  <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463645/4091704-grlands.jpeg" alt="Exploration card"><caption>Exploration</caption>
<p>The rules state that you may play one land per turn. But with Exploration in play, you may play two.</p>

<img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463645/4091705-grcards.jpeg" alt="Howling Mine card"><caption>Howling Mine</caption>
<p>Each player draws one card at the start of their turn. But with Howling Mine in play, each player draws two cards instead.</p>

<img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463645/4091706-grhaste.jpeg" alt="Gingerbrute card"><caption>Gingerbrute</caption>
<p>A creature has summoning sickness the turn it's played. But a creature with "haste" is unaffected by summoning sickness, and is able to attack and tap for abilities as soon as it enters the battlefield.</p>

<p>There are countless exceptions to the rules like these--far too many to list here! The best way to discover them is to start playing. Soon, the card effects and creature abilities that alter the fundamentals of the game will become second nature.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Colors"><header><h2>Colors</h2></header><p>The five different colors in Magic: The Gathering are central to both the gameplay and flavor of the game.</p>
        <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463645/4091783-cardback.jpeg" alt="back oi card"><caption>Source: mtg.fandom.com</caption>
      <p>If you look at the back of any Magic card printed from its inception, you'll see what's known as the "color pie": white, blue, black, red, and green (or "WUBRG," as it's known), in that order. Each color is most closely related to the two adjacent colors (known as "allied colors"), and most at odds with the two across (known as "enemy colors").</p>
      <p>Each color in Magic has its own distinct identity, strengths and weaknesses, strategic overtones, and recurring mechanics. Whenever a new set comes out, the whole picture of each color might shift and evolve somewhat, but the colors' core philosophies have generally stayed consistent over the years. What follows is a brief description of each. For a full picture, including a complete list of mechanics in each color, check out head Magic designer Mark Rosewater's article, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/mechanical-color-pie-2021" target="_blank">Mechanical Color Pie 2021</a>.</p>
